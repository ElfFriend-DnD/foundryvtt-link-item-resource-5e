Adds the ability to link an item's charges or quantity to an actor's resource and thus keep the two always in sync.

Attempts to follow as much of the Item charge consumption logic from the core system as is reasonable. This allows for the following (known) use cases:

- Display the Charges (and Quantities) of any Item/Feature/Spell with limited uses
- Display the Quantities of Ammo Consumable Items (e.g. Arrows)
- Display the Quantities Items which consume their own quantity as Ammo (e.g. Javelin)

Each of these is also editable directly from the Resource indicator.
